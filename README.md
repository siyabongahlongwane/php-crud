CRUD Operations in PHP and MYSQLi

Create a database in phpmyadmin (crudops in my case)

Create a table (user in my case) with 5 fields (id, name, email, mobile and password)

Start your php server and bam! All CRUD operations are in place

Side note, I used the Bootstrap library for the design (Does not affect the program)
